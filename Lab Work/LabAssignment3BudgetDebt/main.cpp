  Purpose:  Percentage budget and Debt/Person
  Write a program to calculate the percentage of the federal budget that the 
  Military and NASA are funded.  You might be surprised.
  Here are your references to use for 2016
  3.54 Trillion       US total spending -->  
  http://federal-budget.insidegov.com/l/119/2016-Estimate  ->  3.54 trillion
  $580 Billion       Military Budget ->

  2)  Calculate the Debt per person given the following years.
